      <description>When we model data we are confronted with the hard problem of encoding complex systems such as businesses, factories, organisations, institutions or online platforms into useful digital representations. A consistent problem I have observed is that for OLAP/data-intensive/AI solutions, data modelling tends to get badly neglected. There are many reasons for this neglect, which we will discuss later, but I believe the main reasons are ignorance, nuance and difficulty. Ignorance about available techniques, technologies, and the meaning of source data.</description>
